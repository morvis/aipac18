<div class="delegate-header">Delegate Check-In</div><br>
<strong>Badge Mailing:</strong> Most delegates will receive their badges by mail before the conference. Badges are mailed individually, even when being sent to the same household. Therefore, badges mailed to the same household may arrive on different days. 
<br><br>
Badges will not be mailed to delegates with mailing addresses outside of the United States. 
<br><br>
<strong>Badge Pick-Up:</strong> If you have not received your badge in the mail, forgotten it at home, or need to make a change to your badge, please visit Delegate Badge Pick-Up in Salon ABC of the Washington Convention Center. Please enter the Washington Convention Center using the doors at 7th Street, NW, and Mt. Vernon Place. 
<br><br>
Badges may only be picked up during the scheduled times listed below. You must claim your badge in person and you must have a government-issued photo ID. A family member or friend cannot pick up a badge on your behalf. 
<br><br>
All children must be registered and must wear a Policy Conference badge. High school delegates who do not have a government-issued photo ID may present a current school-issued photo ID. 
<br><br>
In the event your badge is lost or stolen, please visit the Delegate Badge Pick-Up Desk and we will void and re-print your badge. Once a badge is voided, it will no longer provide access to conference venues or events.

<br><div class="delegate-header">Security</div><br>
The AIPAC Policy Conference takes security very seriously. Badges must be worn and visible at all times. 
<br><br>
You must present your badge and a government-issued photo ID when entering any conference venue. 
<br><br>
The name on your badge and your government-issued photo ID must be a match or near match. 
<br><br>
To enter the Washington Convention Center and the Marriott Marquis all delegates must pass through magnetometers. Magnetometers are sensitive to metal. To ensure quicker entrance into conference venues, be prepared to empty your pockets. Place any pins on your lanyard for easy removal. 
<br><br>
For security reasons, please do not photograph your badge or share it on social media at any time.
<br><br>
<strong>Protestors:</strong> Please do not engage with any protestors or detractors inside or outside Policy Conference venues — or on social media. Please ignore them and simply alert AIPAC staff or security. 
<br><br>
<strong>U.S. Secret Service Security:</strong> Additional security may be added for General Sessions with high-level speakers. This secondary security, administered by the U.S. Secret Service, operates under strict rules that prohibit the following items:
<ul>
<li>Liquids</li>
<li>Laptops</li>
<li>Umbrellas</li>
<li>Luggage</li>

<li>Tools</li>
<li>Pepper Spray/Mace</li>
<li>Sharp Objects</li>

</ul>
<br>
The list of prohibited items is subject to change without warning. 
<br><br>
<strong>Please Note:</strong><br>
U.S. Secret Service may prevent late-arriving delegates from entering the venue. Delegates should allow additional time to clear security throughout the conference.
