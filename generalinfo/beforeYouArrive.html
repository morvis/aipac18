Whether you are a Policy Conference veteran or a "first-timer," there are a few things to keep in mind to make the most of your conference experience. 
<br><br>
<strong>Before the Conference:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Register for your breakout sessions and sign up for special events online using your personalized Agenda Builder. You can access your Agenda Builder by logging in to your MyAIPAC account at MyAIPAC.org and selecting "Details" under Policy Conference '18.</li>
<li>Look out for important emails containing the latest information and updates. </li>
<li>Join the conversation! Use #ChooseToLead and follow @AIPAC on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat!</li>
<li>Contact the Policy Conference Hotline at (202) 639-5363 or policyconference@aipac.org with any questions</li>
</ul>
<strong>During the Conference:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wear your Policy Conference badge at all times. All delegates, regardless of age, must wear a badge while inside the Washington Convention Center and Marriott Marquis. Your badge is your ticket into conference venues and will be scanned upon entrance into each venue and every breakout session. </li>
<li>For security purposes, be prepared to show your government-issued photo ID upon entering the conference venues.</li>
<li>Business attire is recommended throughout the conference.</li>
<li>You will be on your feet, so comfortable shoes are a must!</li>
<li>Arrive on time for the General Sessions, breakout sessions, and lobbying appointments on Capitol Hill.</li>
<li>Questions? Ask an AIPAC staff member. We are here to make your conference experience great!</li>
<li>If you need emergency assistance, please contact the Emergency Hotline at (202) 249-4048.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Updates During the Conference</div><br>
During the conference, check back for updates about the programs you selected, news about special guests and timely reminders. Electronic signs positioned around conference venues will also provide updates, and you can always check for updates at the Conference Concierge Desks. You may also receive emails, texts or push notifications containing timely reminders about your next event. 
<br><br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Access to Sessions</div><br>
<strong>Reservations Required:</strong> All breakout sessions and many special events require advance registration via the Policy Conference Agenda Builder. Conference staff will scan your badges at the door of each session. Therefore, it is critical that you select your sessions in advance of Policy Conference. To access your Agenda Builder, please log in to your MyAIPAC account at MyAIPAC.org. You will also be able to adjust your schedule onsite via the Quick Stop Kiosks set up throughout the conference venues.
<br><br>
<br><div class="delegate-header">Personalized Schedules</div><br>
We recommend that you print your schedule before you arrive at the conference. Rooms and locations will be visible on your personalized schedule the week before the conference. 
<br><br>
To review and print your agenda on site, visit one of the Quick Stop Kiosks located inside the Washington Convention Center in the AIPAC Village or immediately outside of Room 146, or on the M1 level of the Marriott Marquis.
